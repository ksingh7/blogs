## Introduction

Hello World!
[OpenShift](https://short.ksingh.in/rhd-openshift) is an Enterprise-Grade Container Platform that is built on top of Kubernetes and comes with an extensive set of tools and services that make it super easy to build, deploy, and manage applications, part of the credit goes to OpenShift Console. Directly from OpenShift Console you can also launch a cloud shell or a web terminal

In this post i will share details on OpenShift Web Terminal an embedded command line terminal instance in the OpenShift web console. If you are familiar with public cloud providers consoles or portals, you would have noticed a shell icon in the top right corner of the console. OpenShift Web Terminal Operator enables the same functionality on OpenShift.
