WTF (What The Fun) 😎
=====================

Getting started with Kubernetes and you heard about OpenShift ? what if tell you that you don’t need to download client packages on your local machine like `kubectl`, `oc`, `kn` , `tkn` and many more to interact with your OpenShift cluster ?

> Well **OpenShift Web Terminal Operator**, provides you an integrated web terminal directly into your OpenShift Console

**_Work on CLI the GUI way 🧑‍💻 — Karan Singh_**

> If you already have a OpenShift cluster, my recommendation is to install the web terminal operator and enjoy the integrated CLI
