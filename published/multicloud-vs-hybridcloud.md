# LMDTFY Series : MultiCloud Vs Hybrid Cloud

## TL;DR
These two terms are very similar yet different. Lol ;D

- **MultiCloud** : Refers to using multiple clouds from multiple public or private cloud providers for workloads or tasks spanning across said clouds but without any interconnectivity between the clouds.

- **Hybrid Cloud** : Refers to the combination of public and private clouds with some degree of connectivity, integration, portability and unified management.
